You may have heard the commonly touted statement that you should drink 8 glasses of water a day to remain healthy, but is it true, and why is it recommended? Throughout this blog I will look at what the benefits of drinking water are, how much water is actually recommended, and I will finish with some tips to help increase your water intake if it’s something you struggle with.

### Maintenance of bodily fluids

Another common statement is that we are composed of two thirds water. This isn’t far off, and it actually sits around 60% of our body composition. The reason for this is because water plays may different roles within the body and can account for things such as; digestion, absorption, circulation, creation of saliva, transportation of nutrients, and regulating body temperature.

Due to the many different functions, the brain sends signals to the kidneys that communicate how much water needs to be retained to maintain these functions, and the rest is then released as urine. When the requirement for water is greater than the available reserve, your brain sends the signal of thirst; and this is an important cue to pay attention to as it is your body’s way of screaming out to you that you are dehydrated. When at this point, try to consume water in its natural form, but if there is no water available, other substitutes will suffice (juice, milk, coffee, but NOT alcohol).

### Kidney function

As earlier stated, kidneys are the organ that store your water and maintain the water reserve for bodily functions. When you have enough water in the body, your kidneys will release any excess and you will secrete this as urine, and your urine can be a good indicator of your hydration levels. Using the simple analysis of colour and smell, you can measure your hydration levels; the darker and smellier your urine, the less hydrated you are, and vice versa.

Constantly maintaining low levels of water intake can cause the kidneys to malfunction and create kidney stones. This is particularly true in warmer climates.

The biggest benefit to maintain good kidney health outside of water maintenance is their ability to rid your body of toxins. Many toxins are water soluble, meaning they will pass through into the kidney undetected. The kidneys recognise these toxins to be different from the water itself and pass them on to be excreted with your urine.

### Muscle energy

Water is the foundation of all cells and having a lack of water in the system means a lack of water in the cells. This can result in muscle fatigue as the performance of the cells declines. Maintaining the water within these cells is important, and even more so when you exercise; you want to make sure you drink water before, during, and after exercise to maintain your bodily fluids.

### Calorie control

Although water itself isn’t going to help with weight loss, substituted water for other drinks can significantly decrease the number of added calories that may be found in your diet. If your fitness goal is weight loss, making the simple decision to drink water instead of other fluids will give you positive results and can be a quick way to reduce your caloric intake and maintain a calorie deficit (taking in less calories than you need to maintain weight, but we’ll cover that in another blog).

Another hidden benefit of water and calorie control is the water found within foods. Many foods will have water absorbed within, and this will swell the food, giving it a fuller and larger look. These foods will give a higher sensation of fulfilment and you will feel full quicker. This can help with calorie control by simply causing you to eat less. To replicate this effect, you can drink water with your food.

### Good skin

Just as muscle cells, your skin cells contain a large amount of water. When your water levels are lower than needed, your skin cells will NOT be the first to be replenished and in turn will be impacted negatively. Maintaining the water levels in your skin will help prevent having dry and cracked skin, as well as skin wrinkles; rehydrating will improve these factors. Moisturising will help keep the water levels higher within the skin as they block the potential for secretion by creating a physical barrier.

### Bowel function

Keeping your hydration at an adequate level is also important for healthy bowel movements. The water helps prevent constipation as your body has enough fluids elsewhere to leave water within your stools. When dehydrated, the stool becomes the least important place for water to be, and your body extracts the water from your intestine and uses it elsewhere.

### A couple of quick but important notes

Alcohol is bad for hydration as it confuses the communication between the brain and kidney and actually causes more fluid to be excreted than retained. This causes further dehydration, so alcohol should be avoided when feeling dehydrated.

Coffee and tea will not have a detrimental effect on your hydration levels. It is commonly stated that they are both diuretics, and while caffeine does have this effect, you would have to consume a significantly large quantity of coffee or tea to elicit this body response. Actually, coffee and tea can be good sources for hydration as they are mostly water based and replenish any lost stores of water. This being said, natural water is always the best source for hydration.

### How much water should you drink?

On average, a female should look to consume around 2.5litres of water a day, and males are looking at around 3.5litres a day (3.5litres is roughly 1 US gallon); the difference being related to average body mass of the individuals. Sitting right around 3litres will be great for both men and women.

### Quick tips for increasing water intake

1. Always keep a bottle on hand, and never let it sit empty. When you finish the last drop, refill it immediately.
2. Add flavours to your water, whether it be concentrated juices or fruits/vegetables. Also remember, coffee and tea are still good sources of water if you really find these much more manageable to drink.
3. Increase your fruit and vegetable consumption as these have a composition high in water.
4. Learn to drink water; don’t expect to be able to drink gallons in a day if you previously have struggled to drink any. Build up from a little to a lot over time.

### My strategy for measuring water intake

Buy a basic water bottle that can hold 1litre. Fill it up in the morning and drink some immediately. Then, every time you make a drink (like coffee), fill the water portion of that drink from your bottle, and when you simply want water you can drink from the bottle. When the bottle is empty, you know you’ve drank 1litre. Fill it up again, when that’s gone, 2litres done. So on, and so forth. This way you can keep track of exactly how much water you are drinking in a day.

### My strategy for increasing water intake

Start setting time-based goals. If I wake up at 7am, I know before I go to bed at 11pm I need to drink 3litres. Simply, I set a challenge for myself to drink my first litre by 10am, then my second litre by 2pm. Now, I’ll fill my bottle up 1 more time, and as long as I finish my bottle before I go to bed, I’ve conquered my 3litres for the day.
