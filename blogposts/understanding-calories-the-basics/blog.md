You will have heard of calories and will know that you should be somewhat paying attention to how many calories you consume. You may even recognise the numbers 2500 and 2000; that’s the recommended caloric intake for men and women, respectively. Well, I’m going to give you a better understanding of what calories actually are, and how to understand how many you should be taking in.

### Calories (kcal)?

Calories are a unit of measurement used for the energy content of food. As simple as that sounds, you need to understand that different foods provide energy in different ways and we need to give the body these different kinds of calories in order to properly function. The variants of calories you really need to pay attention to are those obtained through protein, carbohydrates (carbs), and fats; these are the macronutrients.

Let’s not worry too much about how these different forms of calories help the body stay regulated and just look at what you need out of each macronutrient. Protein and carbs both contain 4kcal per gram, and fat contains 9kcal per gram. As you can probably already deduce, fats high caloric content is why we tend to avoid fatty foods, however, it is still important it is included in the diet.

### How many calories do you need?

This is solely dependent on your personal goal. Although there are recommended amounts, you have to understand this is based off of the average male and average female, and I’m willing to bet that you are not average. This is nothing to be ashamed of, we as humans can’t simply be given a one-size-fits-all style dietary plan; we’re all unique.

My advice to anyone when trying to understand how many calories they need, is simply to start recording what you eat. DO NOT change a thing. Keep eating what you normally would but be honest in your tracking as this will help you understand your body a whole lot more. When you’ve tracked what you eat for a week, or even two, you will be able to determine roughly what to do from there.

If during this period of tracking you have not lost or gained any weight, the number of calories you are eating on a daily basis (take the overall number of calories and divide by the number of days you tracked) will be your maintenance intake. This simply means, if you consume food as usual with that number of calories, you will continue to stay at the same weight. If you have lost or gained weight during the tracking time, then you know that you would either increase or decrease your caloric intake to find your maintenance level, respectively.

### What to do with this information

Once you have an understanding of your maintenance level of caloric intake you will open up a lot of doors as far as your fitness goals are concerned.

The key for those with weight loss in mind is to eat in a calorie deficit. This simply means consuming less calories than you’re burning. If you were to start exercising you wouldn’t actually have to change your caloric intake at first. Simply by exercising you have already put yourself in a calorie deficit as you are now burning more calories than you were before. Then when your weight starts to stagnate again and you’re no longer losing any, you can remove some calories to start the weight loss up again.

The key for those with weight gain in mind is to eat in a calorie surplus. This simply means consuming more calories than you’re burning. If you were to start exercising in this situation, you would need to really increase your caloric intake to account for the added burned calories, and then the additional needed to put you above your maintenance level. Then when your weight starts to stagnate again and you’re no longer gaining any, you can add some calories to start the weight gain up again.

A simply strategy for either goal is to work in the 500kcal range; when you need to add/remove calories, aim for this many added/removed. Paying attention to your weight gain/loss after this you can see if you’ve added/removed too many or too little, and you can adjust accordingly to take you closer to your maintenance again.

### Healthy weight gain/loss timeline

I’m sure you’ve seen the 30-day transformations when someone has lost 20lbs or gained 20lbs. While this is possible, this should not be an expectation. The ability to do this is dependent on many factors including the initial body composition (how much fat/muscle they have on day 1), someone’s historical body composition (whether they’ve always been overweight/skinny, or it was just a short-term thing), and many other factors.

![don't try to over do it!](./understanding-calories-the-basics/calories_scale.jpg)

A good schedule to aim for is to lose/gain roughly 1% of your body weight during a week. If you weigh 200lbs and want to lose weight, aim for 2lbs per week. As you decrease in weight, notice that this amount to lose will lessen per week, and that’s fine. The same strategy can be used for muscle gain; however, you won’t be able to continue to gain weight at a 1% rate as the body has limitations for growth. So, if you are continuing to gain at 1% relative to your weight each week, then it is likely you are also gaining fat, not just muscle.

### My biggest piece of advice

Pay attention to you and you alone. Don’t look at what others are doing on Instagram or YouTube, don’t try and match pound for pound with your friend with the same goal. Our bodies are unique to us, and so are our fitness journeys. Just because you are the same height and weight as someone, it doesn’t mean you have the same body composition or body history, as well as many other determining factors. This also includes the scales. Yes, the weight can be an important determining factor in some goals, but most of us just want to feel good in how we look. If the scale says your 10lbs over your weight goal but you look great and feel great, then weight doesn’t matter.

Use the strategies outlined above, pay attention to how much your consuming (getting a variety of all the macronutrients), pay attention to how you look and feel, and enjoy the process. Just because you’re losing weight it doesn’t mean you have to eat a strict diet, just lightly manipulate what you already eat, and you will be in a calorie surplus/deficit in no time!
